    #### üîéExploring Higher Education Employee Salaries in Ohio

    Most universities are public institutions that receive government oversight and financial support. As public entities, their financial status and expenditures need to be transparent to ensure the reasonable use of taxpayers' funds. Publicizing the salaries of university employees helps ensure fairness and transparency in the compensation system. A transparent salary system can reduce potential discrimination and bias, while providing employees with a clear understanding of their compensation, thus enhancing internal fairness and trust within the organization. Making salary information public can also aid universities in recruiting and retaining talent, as some prospective employees may consider salary information when deciding whether to apply for or accept a position. Moreover, employees' awareness of their salary status within the institution helps universities remain competitive and attract and retain high-quality faculty and staff. Despite this information being publicly available online, it's often not convenient for comparison.

    Therefore, this tool aims to delve into the salaries of higher education employees from Ohio's public universities dating back to 2011 and visualize this data. Through such efforts, we aim to provide users with an easy way to access useful information. This will help government, media, and the public monitor the financial management and expenditure of universities, provide deeper insights into professional salaries for faculty and staff, and offer valuable information support for those intending to work in Ohio.

    In doing so, we can continually pursue transparency and fairness while providing more beneficial services to university administrators, faculty, staff, and job seekers.
